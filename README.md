I wanted to use some of my knowledge to build a different website, a web where I can have fun at the same time I'm learning more Javascript.

On this proeject I start using class a constructors. I added several audio tracks in which you have the posibility to change the speed and get better rhythms.

On this part of my learning process, I introduce things such a setInterval or the calculation of the speed audio to look like a natural sound.
